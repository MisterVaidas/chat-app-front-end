**Problem Domain**

Our first idea was to create an app that allows users to send and recieve messages in real time, to user-created chat rooms that are saved (along with chat logs) to MongoDB.
To make our app a more unique proposition we decided that our app should have some functionality that would be beneficial to users that were collaboratively learning to code.

**User Story**

As a user I would like to be able to easily create a text-based chat room for myself and my colleagues to work on our code together.
I would like to be able to easily distinguish one user from another and have acces to these chat spaces be limited to approved users.
I would like the chat spaces to persist after logout and be available to use again in the future.
I would like to be able to easy display code to other users simultaneously and also have other users be able to edit that code.
I would like to be able run code in a virtual environment and have the results of that code displayed to all users.
